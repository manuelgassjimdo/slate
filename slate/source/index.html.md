# API Reference

Welcome to the **Business Platform API documentation** at **Jimdo**. Within this documentation you will find a comprehensive description on how to interact with our various API endpoints, that you can ultimately use our shared services to generate value to your users.

The Business Platform API is organized around **[Apache Thrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift)**. Thrift’s rapid binary serialization and countless languages makes it a solid standard as interface language for company wide usage. 

Our API supports multiple protocols like binary protocol, JSON or XML. It uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark boxes to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('manuel');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```



Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
